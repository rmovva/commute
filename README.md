The goal of this work is to better understand and visualize patterns of geographic distribution of Harker students.

The Jupyter notebook "data vis.ipynb" (Python 2) contains the scripts to generate various figures in this analysis. However, the data is not publicly available for privacy reasons - contact Rajiv Movva if you would like the data (and have a good reason to do so :)).
